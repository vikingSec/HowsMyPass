# How's My Pass?

How's My Pass is a tiny, donations-only SaaS app I'm developing as part of my portfolio, and as
an attempt to try to raise awareness for proper password security.

The idea is simple: you input a password, the server tells you how long it would take for someone
to crack that password. The password is never stored anywhere (going to make sure that web logs don't
log the passwords anywhere) and all of the calculations are done client-side.

The monetization structure will be simple... There isn't any. I'm going to include a Stripe donation
link somewhere on the page and will leave it at that.
